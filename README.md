# Homework 1
In the first homework you will work on three problems that are connected to each other. For each problem, you can find here a program that will help tackle the assignment, visualize the problem, and (hopefully) verify the solutions. 
## Assignment 2
Assignment 2 deal with particles escaping a 1D box. We use random numbers to reproduce random configurations and verify results that can be obtained by using statistics.
## Assignment 3
Assignment 3 is a visualization program, in which we simulate a group of non-interacting particles inside a box with reflecting walls. The particles all start in half of the simulation cell and moves towards more random configurations.
## Assignment 4
Assignment 4 is a modified version of the previous assignment, where instead of visualizing the trajectories we plot the number of particles as a function of time. An exponential decay towards equilibrium would be expected, is that what we get? Do we sample configurations correctly? How many times does the system goes back to the initial state (all particles on the left) for small and large systems?
