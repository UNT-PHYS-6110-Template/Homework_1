Exam 1 Take-Home Project
The following is a program to simulate the motion of non-interacting particles inside a box
Time is discretized into small intervals (timesteps), during which the motion of the particles follow some simple physical laws
Trajectories of particles are simulated as a sequence of a large number of timesteps

# Parameters and variables

#    ybox: size of box along the y axis (in arbitrary units)
#    xpos: x component of particles positions (in arbitrary units)
#    ypos: y component of particles positions (in arbitrary units)
#    xvel: x component of particles velocities (in arbitrary units)
#    yvel: y component of particles velocities (in arbitrary units)

    This function describes the motion of a single particle subject to no interactions but elastic reflections from the box walls.
    The particle's coordinates will change according to a constant velocity motion. 
    If the position of the particle falls outside of the box walls, the particle's velocity changes sign (reflection).
    Input arguments:
        dt: timestep; xpos/ypos: particle's coordinate along xy; xvel/yvel: x/y-component of particle's velocity; xbox/ybox: lenghts of box.
